### Introduction

Fedy lets you install multimedia codecs and additional software that Fedora [doesn't want to ship](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/), like H264 support, google-chrome, pre-built applications from 3rd part vendors and much more with just a few clicks.

### Installation

Installation instructions can be found on https://github.com/rpmfusion-infra/fedy.

```sh
# RPM Fusion

```

-->

### Usage

After installation, search for `Fedy` in the menu/overview or type `fedy` in the terminal.

### Plugin structure

Plugins can be placed under `~/.local/share/fedy/plugins/`, or the system plugins directory.

Each plugin is a directory with the suffix `.plugin`, which consist of a JSON formatted metadata file. The metadata file contains information about the plugin and describes how `Fedy` should run the tasks.

The plugins can run any command or scripts (`bash`, `python` etc.). In addtion to the system commands, `Fedy` provides an additional command, `run-as-root` to allow running commands (e.g.- `run-as-root touch /some/file/somewhere`) or scripts (e.g.- `run-as-root -s do-stuff.sh`) as root.

Have a look at the existing plugins to know more about how to write plugins for `Fedy`.
