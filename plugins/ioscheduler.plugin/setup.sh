# This script originally had NOOP as the default scheduler for SSDs, but now deadline is used instead.
# The scheduler variable has replaced by two separate variables, one each for SSDs and HDDs.
# This will make it easier to switch back to NOOP or any other scheduler for both types of hard disks in the future.
